There appears to be a cyclical pattern in the publication trend, with periods of growth followed by stabilization or slight decline. For instance, after the initial growth phase ending in 2004, the number of publications shows stability or minor declines in subsequent years. However, there is a resurgence of growth starting around 2015, leading to another peak in 2020. This cycle may reflect periodic cycles in funding, attention, or major discoveries within the field. Understanding these cycles could help stakeholders anticipate periods of increased activity and plan resources accordingly. For example, research institutions might increase their focus on grant proposals and collaboration efforts ahead of expected growth phases, as seen leading up to the peaks in 2004 and 2020.
