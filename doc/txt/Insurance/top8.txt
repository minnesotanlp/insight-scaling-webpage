The age distribution of insured individuals is skewed towards younger demographics, particularly those in their early twenties, where frequencies reach their peak (~160). This observation suggests that younger age groups may be more actively seeking insurance coverage compared to older individuals. Such a trend might indicate targeted marketing strategies aimed at youths or lower barriers to entry for younger customers. However, this also raises concerns regarding the potential imbalance in risk pooling, as older individuals, who are typically associated with higher risk profiles, are underrepresented in the insured population. Insurance providers should consider revising their outreach strategies to engage and retain older demographics, possibly through tailored offerings or education campaigns, to achieve a more balanced risk portfolio.
