There is a significant upward trend in medical charges as age increases, suggesting that healthcare costs rise systematically with age. This trend is evident from the scattered data points clustering more densely along an upward trajectory that aligns with the fitted regression line. While there are individual variations, particularly among younger age groups, the overall direction of the trend is consistent across both male and female populations, as indicated by the color coding. This insight suggests that older individuals may require more intensive or frequent medical interventions, leading to higher expenses. A potential next step for stakeholders could involve developing targeted healthcare cost management strategies for aging populations, focusing on preventive care or subsidies for individuals aged 60+.
