The pronounced skewness in the distribution of medical charges for smokers, particularly towards the higher end, suggests that smoking may disproportionately impact healthcare costs for a smaller subset of individuals. The long right tail indicates that while some smokers experience relatively normal healthcare expenses, others encounter extremely high costs due to smoking-related complications. This skewed distribution highlights the need for differentiated healthcare approaches, where high-risk smokers are prioritized for more intensive interventions and support. For instance, insurers or public health organizations could develop tailored programs focused on early detection and prevention for this vulnerable subgroup, potentially leading to better health outcomes and cost containment.
