Children show negligible correlation with both age (~0.04) and BMI (~0.01), reinforcing the notion that family size is not a dominant factor in determining medical charges compared to age or BMI. This lack of correlation across demographic attributes highlights the nuanced nature of medical cost drivers, where socioeconomic factors or other unmeasured variables may play a larger role in determining charges. For healthcare administrators, understanding these independence relationships is critical when designing bundled payment models or risk-adjustment mechanisms, as reliance on poorly correlated predictors like children would likely lead to inaccurate cost projections. Further exploration into non-demographic factors such as income level or chronic condition prevalence could improve cost prediction accuracy.
