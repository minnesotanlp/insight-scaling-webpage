For very low attendance levels (below ~50%), there is a significant variability in exam scores, indicated by the longer whiskers and scattered individual data points. This variability suggests that students with low attendance have inconsistent outcomes, possibly due to missing crucial lectures or lacking foundational knowledge. On the other hand, for higher attendance levels (above ~70%), the spread of exam scores reduces, showing more consistent performance among students. This consistency may reflect a stronger engagement with course content and a more structured learning environment. To improve overall academic outcomes, interventions targeting students with low attendance rates could be particularly beneficial, focusing on strategies to reduce absenteeism and ensure foundational knowledge is acquired.
