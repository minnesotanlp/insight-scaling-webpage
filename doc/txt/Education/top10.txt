Despite the general positive relationship, there is a noticeable variability in exam scores even among students who studied similar amounts of time. For example, some students who studied 20 hours achieved scores as low as 60, while others scored close to 90. This variability suggests that factors other than study duration, such as study methods, prior knowledge, or individual learning styles, play a crucial role in determining exam outcomes. Therefore, schools should explore diversifying teaching strategies or personalizing study guidance to address these variations, potentially leading to more consistent performance across students. A pilot program testing different study techniques with students who study a similar amount of time could help identify more effective approaches.
