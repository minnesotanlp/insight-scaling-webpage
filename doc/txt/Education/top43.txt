The chart reveals a weak positive correlation between the number of tutoring sessions and exam scores, indicated by the Pearson correlation coefficient of r=0.16. Despite this weak relationship, the trend line shows a slight upward trajectory as the number of tutoring sessions increases. However, there is significant variability in exam scores across different numbers of tutoring sessions, suggesting that other factors may play a larger role in determining exam performance. For instance, the range of scores for 1 tutoring session spans from approximately 50 to 95, which highlights the complexity of predicting outcomes based solely on tutoring sessions. This suggests that educational institutions might consider exploring additional interventions to complement tutoring, such as targeted study materials or personalized feedback, to potentially boost student performance more effectively.
