While 'Medium' access to resources provides moderate exam scores, it does not appear to compensate as effectively for the lack of internet access as other conditions. For example, students with 'Medium' access and 'No' internet have a mean score of 66.8, slightly below 'High' access with 'No' internet (67.0). This suggests that 'Medium' resource levels alone might not be sufficient to offset the disadvantages of limited internet access. Schools or policy initiatives focused on boosting resources for these students could aim to move them closer to 'High' access thresholds, particularly in areas where internet penetration is low. A strategic goal could be to increase 'Medium' access scores by at least 0.5 points when 'No' internet is present, through targeted investments in resource augmentation over the next five years.
