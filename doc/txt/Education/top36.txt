While 'Previous_Scores' show a moderate positive correlation (~0.18) with 'Exam_Score,' the influence appears weaker compared to 'Hours_Studied' and 'Attendance.' This suggests that prior academic performance has some predictive power but is not the sole determinant of current exam scores. Educational interventions aimed at improving overall performance might need to focus more on current behaviors like studying and attending classes, rather than solely relying on previous scores as predictors of success. A balanced approach addressing both past performance and current engagement could yield better results.
