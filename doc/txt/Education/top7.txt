The category with 'High' access to resources and no extracurricular activities (795) is unexpectedly large, revealing a subgroup that does not utilize available opportunities. This could indicate preferences, time constraints, or misalignment between offered programs and interests. Educational institutions or policymakers should explore survey-based feedback mechanisms to understand the motivations behind non-participation. By identifying and addressing these reasons, they could achieve a 15% reduction in the 'No' category within the 'High' access group over the next academic year, thereby better aligning resource utilization with actual demand.
