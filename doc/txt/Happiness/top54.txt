The correlation matrix shows that 'Social Support' has moderately strong positive correlations with 'Life Ladder' (0.72) and 'Log GDP Per Capita' (0.68), suggesting that social cohesion and support systems contribute to both subjective well-being and economic prosperity. However, the relatively weak correlation with 'Generosity' (0.07) raises questions about whether social support independently drives charitable behavior or if it requires additional factors. For example, cultivating a sense of community through public policy could enhance social support, which in turn might indirectly encourage generosity by fostering empathy. A potential strategy could involve local governments investing in community-building initiatives, aiming to boost social support scores by 30% within five years, thereby exploring indirect pathways to influence generosity.
