There appears to be a diminishing marginal return effect of GDP on happiness as we move to higher GDP per capita levels. While the red regression line shows a positive correlation, the slope begins to flatten as the Log GDP Per Capita increases toward the right end of the x-axis. This implies that while economic growth significantly enhances happiness initially, its impact plateaus at higher GDP levels. This observation aligns with the concept of the 'Easterlin Paradox,' which posits that beyond a certain level of affluence, further economic gains do not substantially improve subjective well-being. Policymakers targeting happiness maximization should focus on ensuring equitable distribution of wealth rather than solely pursuing economic growth once a country reaches a certain prosperity threshold. For example, redistributive policies and investments in social services may yield better results in enhancing happiness compared to further GDP-driven strategies.
