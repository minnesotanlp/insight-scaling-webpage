There is a negative correlation between perceptions of corruption and confidence in the national government, as indicated by the concentration of high-density areas (yellow-green regions) towards the bottom-right and top-left quadrants of the heatmap. Specifically, as the perceptions of corruption increase (approaching 1.0), confidence in the government decreases, and vice versa. This suggests that public perception of corruption significantly influences trust levels in governance. The density distribution demonstrates that the majority of data points lie along this trend, highlighting the importance of addressing corruption to restore public trust. Policymakers should focus on implementing transparent anti-corruption measures to shift the population towards higher confidence levels, using interventions targeted at regions with high corruption perceptions (e.g., a policy aimed at reducing corruption levels by 0.2 points within two years).
