The data demonstrates a non-linear drop in confidence as perceptions of corruption rise. While the decline is gradual at lower corruption levels (below 0.3), the rate of decline accelerates significantly once perceptions exceed 0.5. This sharp decrease suggests that public tolerance for corruption has a threshold beyond which confidence rapidly diminishes. Such non-linearity may indicate that citizens are willing to overlook minor instances of corruption but become highly sensitive to more pervasive issues. Policymakers should therefore focus intensively on preventing corruption from crossing this threshold to avoid sudden trust collapses. Developing early detection systems and rapid response mechanisms for emerging corruption could be key strategies to maintain confidence.
