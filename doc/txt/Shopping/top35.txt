The payment method landscape indicates a competitive environment among the top four methods—Credit Card, PayPal, Cash, and Debit Card—all contributing approximately 17%-18% of total sales. This close parity suggests that customers have diverse preferences, making it critical for businesses to maintain flexibility in their payment options. Given the similarity in usage across these methods, marketing strategies should focus on enhancing user experience and incentives across multiple platforms to capture a larger share of customer preference. The small differences (~1%) between these methods imply that even slight improvements in user convenience or loyalty programs could shift customer choices noticeably.
