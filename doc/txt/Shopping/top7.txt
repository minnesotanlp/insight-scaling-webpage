Clothing demonstrates a cyclical trend in popularity across seasons, peaking in Spring and rebounding in Winter. In Spring, the total purchase amount for clothing surpasses $27,000, indicating its seasonal demand spike. After declining in Summer to around $23,000, there's a noticeable recovery in Fall, hovering close to $26,000, followed by another peak in Winter nearing the Spring levels. This cyclicality likely reflects consumer behavior driven by seasonal fashion changes. Retailers may consider increasing inventory and marketing efforts during Spring and Winter to capitalize on this peak demand, focusing on innovative products and discounts in Summer to maintain sales traction.
