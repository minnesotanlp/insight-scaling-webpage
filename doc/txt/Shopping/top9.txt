Footwear demand exhibits noticeable seasonal variation, showing higher purchases in Summer (160) and Spring (163), compared to Fall (136) and Winter (140). This suggests that warmer seasons may trigger increased demand for lighter footwear types. Retailers might consider adjusting inventory levels or launching promotions during the warmer months to maximize sales. Conversely, the relatively lower demand in colder seasons may signal the need for different marketing strategies focused on winter boots or heavier footwear options. This seasonal disparity highlights the importance of adapting inventory management and advertising based on weather trends.
