Bank transfers exhibit a periodic pattern, with usage peaking during the bi-weekly and quarterly purchase intervals. These intervals show higher scores (88 and 109, respectively) compared to monthly and weekly intervals. This cyclical behavior may reflect structured payment cycles where consumers prefer bank transfers for routine financial planning. Businesses could leverage this by offering bank transfer discounts during these intervals, potentially increasing transaction volumes by appealing to customers with structured purchasing habits. For instance, promoting bank transfers during bi-weekly and quarterly cycles could see a 10-15% increase in usage within six months.
