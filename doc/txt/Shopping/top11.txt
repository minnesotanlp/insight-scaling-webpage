Summer has the lowest average review rating at approximately 3.71, suggesting it might be the most challenging season for maintaining customer satisfaction. This dip could stem from factors like intense competition, user fatigue, or a shift in consumer priorities during the warmer months. Given that summer marks a notable low compared to other seasons, the company might benefit from conducting seasonal analyses to pinpoint the exact causes. For instance, they could survey customers specifically in summer to understand their concerns better. Once identified, actions like implementing summer-exclusive features, improving logistics, or offering seasonal discounts could help lift ratings closer to other seasons' benchmarks.
