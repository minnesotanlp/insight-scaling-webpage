The relationship between glucose and insulin levels across the outcomes reveals an indirect linkage tied to metabolic health. While glucose levels differ sharply between outcomes 0 and 1, insulin levels also exhibit a distinct pattern indicative of different physiological states. For outcome 0, the low insulin levels coupled with relatively normal glucose suggest a lack of metabolic stress or insulin resistance. Conversely, the high insulin levels in outcome 1, even though glucose levels are elevated, imply compensatory insulin secretion possibly to counteract insulin resistance. This observation underscores the complex interplay between glucose metabolism and insulin response. Healthcare providers could implement strategies to assess insulin sensitivity concurrently with glucose monitoring, focusing on interventions such as lifestyle modifications or medications to address insulin resistance for patients with outcomes consistent with outcome 1.
