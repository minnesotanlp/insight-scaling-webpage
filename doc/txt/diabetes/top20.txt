The sharp increase in insulin levels observed in Outcome 1 around age 60 suggests a significant metabolic shift that could indicate the onset of severe diabetic complications. This peak, exceeding 400 units, stands out as an anomaly compared to the consistent trend in Outcome 0, where insulin levels remain relatively stable and decline gradually after peaking earlier. The dramatic spike likely reflects heightened insulin resistance or hyperglycemia, conditions commonly associated with advanced diabetes progression. This finding suggests that individuals with Outcome 1 may benefit from more intensive monitoring and intervention during this critical period, potentially delaying the progression of diabetes-related complications.
