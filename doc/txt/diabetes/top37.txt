Glucose shows moderate correlations with several features: BMI (0.22), BloodPressure (0.15), and Insulin (0.33). This pattern indicates that glucose levels are influenced by a combination of body composition and metabolic activity. The presence of these correlations may highlight the complex interplay between lifestyle factors and physiological responses. For instance, interventions aimed at reducing BMI and managing BloodPressure might indirectly help stabilize glucose levels in pre-diabetic populations. Further studies could investigate whether a multi-faceted approach addressing all correlated factors leads to more effective glucose control compared to single-focus strategies. The threshold for action could be set at identifying individuals with simultaneous elevations in these correlated metrics, targeting early intervention protocols.
